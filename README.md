**DISCLAIMER:** This SlackBot is only available for the Product College workspace.

LyricBot is a SlackBot built in golang and tries its best to look up the lyrics of a song you provide it.

For example if you provide the following query in your Slack interface:

![slack interface](https://github.com/EconClass/MusicBot/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-07%20at%208.13.36%20PM.png)

It will respond with the folowing:

```
I'm gonna make a change,
For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good,
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
...
